        <p>I like to dance even though I don't know how to dance. To be true, I can't really say that I dance for exercise because I don't do enough to deserve that claim. Basically, it is just a little body movement that help me get rid of the body stiffness. Talking and spending time with friends is another things I enjoy. My friends and I talk a lot, but I don't really know where the subjects came from. All I know, it is always planty of them there.</p>
